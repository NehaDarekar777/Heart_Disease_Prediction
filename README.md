# Heart_Disease

The goal of the project is to predict whether the patient has heart disease or not by using required features.

## Features will be using are:
* age: age in years
* sex: sex (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
* cp: Chest Pain Type
  - 1: (0 = Typical Angina)
  - 2: (1 = Atypical Angina)
  - 3: (2 = Non-anginal Pain)
  - 4: (3 = Asymtomatic)
* trtbps: Resting Blood Pressure in mmHg
* chol: Serum Cholesterol in mg/dl
* fbs: Fasting Blood Sugar 
* restecg: Resting ECG Results
    - 1: (0 = Normal)
    - 2: (1 = having ST-T wave abnormality)
    - 3: (2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
* thalachh: Maximum heart rate achieved
* exng: Exercise induced Angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* slp: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
   - 1: (0 = Upsloping)
   - 2: (1 = Flat)
   - 3: (2 = Downsloping)
* caa: Number of Major Vessels
* thall: Thalassemia
     - 1: (0 = Normal)
     - 2: (1 = Fixed Defect)
     - 3: (2 = Reversible Defect)
